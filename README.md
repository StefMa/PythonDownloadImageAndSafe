# PythonDownloadImageAndSafe

## What is it?
This is only a demonstration how to download a HTML-"SourceCode", parse it (find some pattern), download images and save them locally.

## But... why?
I need a little script which parse a HTML site and download some images from them and store they locally.
The website contains a lot of images and I don't want use my hand (and mouse) to store them.

## How to tun?
Just run via terminal
```bash
$ python3 download_images_and_save.py
